This projectâ€™s purpose was a complete redesign of the Variete Theatre website. Using user research, and feedback analysis, I redesigned the information architecture, developed interactive wireframes, and implemented a visually captivating design. The result was an easy to use and visually appealing website that effectively showcased upcoming shows, simplified ticket booking and enhanced overall user experience.
